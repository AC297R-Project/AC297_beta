        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h4>Experimentation:</h4>
        <p>We were able to reduce correlation and volatility over traditional
          S&amp;P hedging in our dynamic portfolio Greedy implementation, but
          the method returned results that were lower than holding money in
          savings accounts would have been in that time.&nbsp; While we did not
          ultimately identify a risk management strategy that we believe would
          be practical to apply in real life, we did perform careful, thorough,
          and systematic experiments that allowed us to confidently conclude
          that this beta hedging market optimization is not a promising
          direction.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The following list summarizes the experimentation strategies that we
          used to reach this conclusion:</p>
        <p>1) Runs in different market conditions.&nbsp; We trained and tested
          our method in a variety of real-life market conditions, including
          during bull markets, volatile markets, free-falling crashes, and early
          recoveries.&nbsp; While we did see that we could consistently mitigate
          losses during crashes, we always saw that the lost returns during good
          times (which are much more common) significantly outweighed the
          prevented losses.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>2) A variety of portfolios.&nbsp; Within each time period that we
          tested, we trained and tested on many portfolios to rule out that we
          were overfitting to a particular portfolio.&nbsp; We were able to
          generate measures of variability (visualized as error bars or bands in
          our plots) in our results in this way, and saw that this level of
          variability somewhat higher for our optimized hedged portfolios than
          it was for S&amp;P hedged portfolios, and unhedged portfolios.&nbsp;
          This allowed us to conclude that while we might improve the measures
          of interest (correlation and volatility) on average, the inconsistency
          of these results stemming from the stochasticity in our optimization
          may dampen the benefits of optimizing for stability.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>3) Many repetitions on a single portfolio.&nbsp; We also performed
          tests in which we performed the same optimization to a single
          portfolio multiple times.&nbsp; In this way, we were able to observe
          the variability in results that came solely from the
          optimization.&nbsp; While this variability was smaller than the
          variability that came from the variety in portfolios in our batch
          simulations described above, it was useful to observe that each run of
          the optimization did not guarantee the same results, and this would be
          important to a user who might be considering using this method instead
          of traditional S&amp;P hedging.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>4) Long term runs with dynamic portfolios.&nbsp; To observe the
          long-term performance of our method, we finally brought together all
          of the forms of experimentation described above into a single large
          batch experiment, in which we simulated investing continuously over a
          period of 10 years, updating the portfolio every 3 months, and
          performed the optimization 100 times for the same portfolio in each
          quarter.&nbsp; This allowed us to generalize the patterns that we were
          seeing in our shorter-term simulations to a long time horizon, and
          conclusively say that for a medium investment horizon, the reduction
          in correlation and volatility that comes from our method is probably
          not worth the loss in long-term returns.&nbsp; </p>
        <h4>Other hedging strategies that would be interesting to pursue:</h4>
        <p>1) Delta hedging: Hedge the risk associated with price movements in
          the underlying asset by offsetting long and short positions. You make
          money based on volatility, not returns.<br>
          <br>
          2) Extension to beta hedging (using options that are cheaper): Buying
          only index put options to hedge the value of a portfolio.<br>
          <br>
          3) Hedge directly against market volatility by trading VIX.<br>
          <br>
          4) Long-short portfolio.<br>
          <br>
          5) Stay in cash.</p>

        <h4>Discussions:</h4>
        <p>1) Is our greedy portfolio selection strategy actually effective?<br>
          <br>
          2) Is beta hedging ever the right choice?<br>
          <br>
          3) How would transaction costs affect things?</p>
        <p>4) Could beta hedging still work while not changing the entire
          hedging market every quarter?</p>
